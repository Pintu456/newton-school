                <h2>About Babasaheb</h2>
                <p><b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b> (14 April 1891 - 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist,
                    social
                    reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the
                    Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal
                    Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

                    Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, and studied economics at Columbia
                    University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923 respectively
                    and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.
                    He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist,
                    professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in
                    campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political
                    rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the
                    state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

                    In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar.
                    The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by
                    the honorific Babasaheb.</p>
